== README

Original Ruby on Rails version of http://www.destinymatches.com

The purpose of this site is to find matches played with other / against players in the game Destiny.

The purpose of this project was to experiment with Ruby on Rails and compare it to Java.

This has since been rewritten in Java for quick support of Destiny 2.  As there were people using the site I wanted to ensure I could add functionality as quickly and with as little down time as possible so I decided to fallback to Java where I am most experienced.
